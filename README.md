## 6. Data Model

### Case Entity

```typescript
interface Case {
  id: UUID
  survivor: Survivor
  reporter: Contact
  perpetrators: Perpetrator[]
  status: 'open' | 'investigating' | 'resolved'
  priority: number
  categories: string[]
  narrative: string
  sentiment_score?: number
  ai_summary?: string
  attachments: FileMetadata[]
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

### Call Entity

```typescript
interface Call {
  id: UUID
  direction: 'inbound' | 'outbound'
  fromNumber: string
  toNumber: string
  startTime: DateTime
  endTime: DateTime
  transcript?: string
  sentiment_score?: number
  recordingUrl?: string
  disposition: string
  caseId?: UUID
}
```

## 7. API Specifications

### Cases API

| Endpoint           | Method | Description             |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------- |
| /cases             | GET    | List cases with filters |
| /cases             | POST   | Create new case         |
| /cases/{id}        | GET    | Get case details        |
| /cases/{id}/status | PATCH  | Update case status      |

### AI API

| Endpoint            | Method | Description                     |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| /ai/classify-case   | POST   | Predict case category from text |
| /ai/transcribe-call | POST   | Transcribe audio file           |
| /ai/translate       | POST   | Translate text input            |
| /ai/sentiment       | POST   | Analyze sentiment of text       |
