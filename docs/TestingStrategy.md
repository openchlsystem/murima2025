    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/v1/cases')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${testToken}`)
      .send(caseData);

    // Assert
    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.data).toHaveProperty('id');
    expect(response.body.data.title).toBe(caseData.title);
    
    // Verify database state
    const savedCase = await db.query('SELECT * FROM cases WHERE id = $1', [response.body.data.id]);

  When I receive an incoming call from a customer
  Then I should see the customer information if available
  And I should be able to create a new case for the customer
  When I classify the case as "billing inquiry"
  Then the relevant form fields should appear
  When I complete the required information and submit the case
  Then the case should be created successfully
  And I should be able to add call notes
  And the call should be recorded if consent is given
```

## 3. Test Environments

### 3.1 Environment Strategy

The testing strategy involves four distinct environments:

| Environment | Purpose | Refreshed | Data |
|-------------|---------|-----------|------|
| Development | Developer testing | On-demand | Synthetic |
| Testing | QA testing | Weekly | Synthetic + Anonymized |
| Staging | Pre-production validation | With production releases | Production clone (anonymized) |
| Production | Live system | N/A | Real data |

### 3.2 Environment Specifications

#### 3.2.1 Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Individual developer testing, unit testing

```

## 4. Test Data Management

### 4.1 Test Data Strategy

The test data strategy focuses on:
- Providing sufficient data coverage for all test scenarios
- Ensuring data privacy and compliance
- Maintaining data consistency and integrity
- Supporting automated testing needs

### 4.2 Test Data Sources

| Source | Use Case | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Synthetic Data | Most testing | Generated user accounts, cases, interactions |
| Anonymized Production Data | Performance testing, data migration testing | Production data with PII replaced |
| Golden Test Data Sets | Regression testing, integration testing | Pre-defined data for specific test scenarios |
| Dynamically Generated Data | Automated testing | Data created during test execution |

### 4.3 Test Data Generation

- **Tools**: Faker.js, Database Seeding Scripts, Custom Data Generators
- **Approach**: Schema-based data generation aligned with business rules
- **Randomization**: Controlled randomization for realistic data variation
- **Relationships**: Maintenance of referential integrity and business rules

Example Data Generation Script:
```javascript
// Example test data generation for case management
const { faker } = require('@faker-js/faker');
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

function generateTestCases(count, tenantId) {
  const caseTypes = ['customer_service', 'technical_support', 'billing', 'complaint'];
  const statuses = ['open', 'in_progress', 'pending', 'resolved', 'closed'];
  const priorities = ['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'];
  
  return Array(count).fill().map(() => ({
    id: uuidv4(),
    tenant_id: tenantId,
    case_number: `CS-${faker.random.alphaNumeric(8).toUpperCase()}`,
    title: faker.hacker.phrase(),
    description: faker.lorem.paragraphs(2),
    status: faker.helpers.arrayElement(statuses),
    priority: faker.helpers.arrayElement(priorities),
    case_type_id: faker.helpers.arrayElement(caseTypes),
    created_by: uuidv4(),
    assigned_to: Math.random() > 0.3 ? uuidv4() : null,
    created_at: faker.date.past(1),
    updated_at: faker.date.recent(),
    due_date: Math.random() > 0.5 ? faker.date.future(0.3) : null,
    custom_fields: {
      customer_id: faker.random.alphaNumeric(10),
      product_id: Math.random() > 0.5 ? faker.random.alphaNumeric(8) : null,
      source: faker.helpers.arrayElement(['phone', 'email', 'web', 'social']),
    },
    tags: Array(Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)).fill().map(() => 
      faker.helpers.arrayElement(['urgent', 'vip', 'complaint', 'feedback', 'technical', 'billing'])
    )
  }));
}
```

### 4.4 Data Masking and Anonymization

For anonymized production data:

- **Personal Identifiers**: Replaced with realistic but fictional data
- **Contact Information**: Replaced with non-functional values
- **Sensitive Data**: Completely randomized or removed
- **Relationships**: Preserved to maintain data integrity

Example Anonymization Process:
```sql
-- Example SQL for anonymizing production data
UPDATE users
SET 
  first_name = 'User_' || substr(md5(first_name || id::text), 1, 8),
  last_name = 'User_' || substr(md5(last_name || id::text), 1, 8),
  email = 'user_' || substr(md5(email), 1, 8) || '@example.com',
  phone_number = '+1' || floor(random() * 9000000000 + 1000000000)::text;

-- Keep certain test accounts unchanged
WHERE email NOT LIKE '%@murima2025.com';
```

### 4.5 Test Data Management Process

1. **Planning**: Identify data requirements for test scenarios
2. **Generation**: Create or extract and anonymize test data
3. **Validation**: Verify data meets requirements and business rules
4. **Distribution**: Load data into test environments
5. **Maintenance**: Refresh, update, or extend test data as needed
6. **Cleanup**: Remove test data after testing is complete

### 4.6 Test Data Versioning

- Test data sets versioned alongside application code
- Database migration scripts include test data updates
- Reference data managed as code in version control
- Golden test data sets maintained with clear versioning

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

### 6.1 Automation Objectives

- Increase test coverage and efficiency
- Reduce regression testing time
- Improve test consistency and repeatability
- Enable continuous testing in the CI/CD pipeline
- Support agile development with rapid feedback

### 6.2 Automation Approach

The automation approach follows the **Automation Pyramid**:

```
                ▲ Less
               / \
              /   \
             /     \
            /  UI   \
           /  Tests  \
          /           \
         /  API Tests  \
        /               \
       /                 \
      /   Unit Tests      \
     /_____________________ \
                          More ▼
```

This pyramid represents:
1. **Unit Tests**: Most numerous, fastest to run
2. **API/Integration Tests**: Service-level tests
3. **UI Tests**: Fewest, focused on critical paths

### 6.3 Automation Framework Design

#### 6.3.1 Core Principles
- **Modularity**: Reusable components and test steps
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure and coding standards
- **Scalability**: Support for parallel execution
- **Reliability**: Stable tests with minimal flakiness
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive test results and metrics
