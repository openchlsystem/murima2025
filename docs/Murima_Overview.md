# Murima Project Overview

## What is Murima?

Murima is a modern, comprehensive platform designed to help organizations manage their client communications and case handling more effectively. Think of it as a central hub where all client interactions—whether through phone calls, text messages, emails, social media, or web chat—come together in one organized system.

## The Problem We're Solving

Many organizations today struggle with:
- **Scattered Communications**: Client messages come through different channels (phone, email, WhatsApp, social media) but are handled separately
- **Lost Information**: Important client details and interaction history get lost between different systems
- **Inefficient Processes**: Manual, paper-based processes that slow down response times
- **Limited Visibility**: Supervisors can't easily see how their teams are performing or where bottlenecks occur
- **Compliance Challenges**: Difficulty maintaining proper records for regulatory requirements
- **Scalability Issues**: Systems that work for small teams but break down as organizations grow

## What Murima Offers

## Deployment Options: Choose What Works for You

**Best for**: Most organizations looking for quick deployment and minimal IT overhead

**How it works**: 
- Your organization gets its own secure space (subdomain) like `yourorg.murima.com`
- We handle all technical maintenance, updates, and security

- Pay a monthly subscription based on your usage

**Benefits**:
- Quick setup (days, not months)

### On-Premises Deployment
**Best for**: Government agencies, healthcare providers, or organizations with strict data residency requirements

**How it works**:

## Multi-Tenancy: Secure Isolation Made Simple

**What it means**: Multiple organizations can safely use the same platform without ever seeing each other's data.

**Think of it like apartments in a building**:
- Each organization has its own "apartment" (tenant space)
- You have your own key and can only access your space
- You can customize your space to fit your needs
- The building infrastructure (electricity, plumbing) is shared efficiently
- Each apartment is completely private and secure

**Benefits for organizations**:
