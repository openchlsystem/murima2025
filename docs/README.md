# Murima2025 System Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation repository contains comprehensive system design and technical documentation for the Murima2025 project. The purpose of this documentation is to provide clear, detailed, and up-to-date information about the system's requirements, architecture, design, implementation, and usage guidelines. It serves as the single source of truth for all stakeholders involved in the development, maintenance, and use of the system.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several key documents, each serving a specific purpose in describing different aspects of the system. The structure follows standard software engineering documentation practices to ensure completeness and clarity.

## Documents Overview

### 1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

- **Primary Audience**: Project managers, developers, testers, and stakeholders

### 2. Software Design Document (SDD)
- **Filename**: `SDD.md`
- **Purpose**: Describes the software design and implementation details
- **Content**: Design patterns, component designs, algorithms, and implementation considerations
- **Primary Audience**: Software developers and architects

### 3. System Architecture Document
- **Filename**: `SystemArchitecture.md`
- **Purpose**: Provides a high-level overview of the system architecture
- **Content**: System components, interactions, deployment models, and technology stack
- **Primary Audience**: System architects, developers, and DevOps engineers

### 4. API Documentation
- **Filename**: `API.md`
- **Purpose**: Documents all API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods
- **Content**: RESTful API specifications, request examples, response schemas, and error handling
- **Primary Audience**: Frontend developers, API integrators, and third-party developers

### 5. Database Design Document
- **Filename**: `DatabaseDesign.md`
- **Purpose**: Details the database schema, relationships, and data models
- **Content**: Entity-relationship diagrams, table definitions, indexes, and data flow
- **Primary Audience**: Database administrators and backend developers

### 6. Deployment Guide
- **Filename**: `DeploymentGuide.md`
- **Purpose**: Provides instructions for deploying the system in various environments
- **Content**: Environment setup, deployment steps, configuration, and troubleshooting
- **Primary Audience**: DevOps engineers, system administrators, and IT operations

### 7. User Manual
- **Filename**: `UserManual.md`
- **Purpose**: Guides end-users on how to use the system effectively
- **Content**: Feature descriptions, step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and FAQs
- **Primary Audience**: End-users and support staff

### 8. Testing Strategy Document
- **Filename**: `TestingStrategy.md`
- **Purpose**: Outlines the approach to testing the system
- **Content**: Test plans, test cases, testing environments, and quality assurance processes
- **Primary Audience**: QA engineers, testers, and developers

## How to Navigate the Documentation

1. **Start with the README (this file)** to get an overview of available documentation
2. **For new team members**: Begin with the SRS, then the System Architecture Document
3. **For developers**: Focus on the SDD, API Documentation, and Database Design Document
4. **For deployment team**: Refer to the Deployment Guide
5. **For end-users**: Consult the User Manual

Cross-references between documents are provided where relevant to help navigate related information.

## Document Maintenance Guidelines

### Version Control
- All documentation is version-controlled alongside the codebase
- Major document updates should be committed with descriptive commit messages
- Use Markdown format for consistency and ease of maintenance

### Update Frequency
- Documents should be reviewed and updated at the following times:
  - After each major release
  - When significant system changes are implemented
  - During sprint retrospectives (for agile teams)
  - At least quarterly for accuracy verification

### Document Owners
Each document has a designated owner responsible for maintaining its accuracy:
- SRS: Product Manager
- SDD & System Architecture: Lead Architect
- API Documentation: Backend Lead
- Database Design: Database Administrator
- Deployment Guide: DevOps Lead
- User Manual: UX Lead or Technical Writer
- Testing Strategy: QA Lead

### Contribution Process
1. For minor updates: Edit the document directly and create a pull request
2. For major changes: Create an issue describing the proposed changes before editing
3. All changes should be reviewed by the document owner before merging

### Formatting Standards
- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include a table of contents for documents longer than 500 lines
- Use consistent headings (# for title, ## for major sections, ### for subsections)
- Include diagrams where applicable (store diagram source files in the `/docs/diagrams` directory)
